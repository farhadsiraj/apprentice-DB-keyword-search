TODO: * Store mongoDB credentials in an environment var.

    * Persist all data to mongo DB 

    Trying to get the rows from database.js to index.js (app.get(/processes))
    - on wordMatcher.js, traverse through contents in the DB(backend) looking for keyword matches
    - Learn regex??
    - return process_id for all matches
    
    * Organize file structure.

    * Refactor traverseProcesses function in the frontend/

    * Set up some authentication in the backend to make sure requests are coming from approved address
        - CORS configuration

    * Add ability to expand/collapse process categories
        - Ex. There are x processe under "Principles and Practices", by clicking on the category
        you can expand/collapse them, similar to how its done for Work Processes and Competencies

    * Refactor!!!
        - Organize, modularize, 
        - Shorten functions
        - Separate Concerns

    * Package up the the comps after iterating through them
        - Send them to backend
        - Practice sending all the data at once and one by one asynchronously.
            - Package all the wp's then send those out and continue going through the rest of competencies.

    * Make a backend using node and connect it to sqlite3
        - Think about the design of your database

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.

    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?
