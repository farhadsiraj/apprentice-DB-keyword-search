TODO:
    * Dont scan through processes everytime
       - persist the data somewhere so that in the beginning you can just search through a database instead

    * Why cant I scroll after the script finishishes???

    * Do I have to do this synchronously. Wont the events just get queud up everytime??


    * Come up with a better solution to just setting `overflow = auto` after scanning all texts
       - setting the overflow property on the modal instead.
