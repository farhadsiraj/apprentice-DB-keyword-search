TODO:  

    * Iterate through processes and persist them to the database
        - Draw up routes
        - 
        - Iterate and save them into and object
        - Send that data to the backend to be persisted
        - Check if all went good

    * Make a backend using node and connect it to sqlite3
        - Think about the design of your database

    * Dont scan through processes everytime
       - persist the data somewhere so that in the beginning you can just search through a database instead

    * Do I have to do this synchronously. Wont the events just get queud up everytime??

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.

    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?
