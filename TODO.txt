TODO:  

    Currently: fix mutationObserver not picking up when modal opens or closes

    * Refactor!!!
        - Organize, modularize, 
        - Shorten functions
        - Separate Concerns


    * Package up the the comps after iterating through them
        - Send them to backend
        - Practice sending all the data at once and one by one asynchronously.

    * Iterate through processes and persist them to the database
        - Draw up routes
        - 
        - Iterate and save them into and object
        - Send that data to the backend to be persisted
        - Check if all went good

    * Make a backend using node and connect it to sqlite3
        - Think about the design of your database

    * Do I have to do the process traversing synchronously or can it be done async.
        - Wont the events just get queud up everytime??

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.

    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?
