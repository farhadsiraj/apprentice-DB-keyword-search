TODO:  
    Currently: POST data to backend and persist to both process and criteria tables.
    https://javascript.info/fetch

    * Set up some authentication in the backend to make sure requests are coming from approved address
        - CORS configuration

    * Refactor!!!
        - Organize, modularize, 
        - Shorten functions
        - Separate Concerns

    * Package up the the comps after iterating through them
        - Send them to backend
        - Practice sending all the data at once and one by one asynchronously.
            - Package all the wp's then send those out and continue going through the rest of competencies.


    * Make a backend using node and connect it to sqlite3
        - Think about the design of your database

    * Come up with a better solution to scrolling after iterating processes
        - Setting overflow property at the end of script is the current solution.

    * Make it so that it runs even when dropdowns are open?
